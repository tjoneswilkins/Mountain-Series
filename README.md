###### Data: "facts and statistics collected together for refrence or analysis." 
This definition is technical, blocky, one dimentional. Data is generally refered to as numbers, represententive of something conceptual, or too great to understand without systems of data. However, data can be used for many other things, say when you mix data statistics and literature. That product may be something like an word cloud, or autocomplete.

###### Data is a tool 
When combined with other mediums it creates something bigger than the data. It can convey feelings, emotions, and thoughts. Think of the hammer, one dimentional, not many uses, limited creative uses. Combine the hammer with nails, and wood, and you can build a house.

In this project I had one small, *one dimentional* data set. The confirmed Covid-19 case numbers for my home state of Arkansas.
